  <h1 id="header">A Little About Me</h1>
  <p id="text">I grew up in Mansfield, Ohio. I went to high school at Lucas. I am the youngest of four in my family! I enjoyed sports growing up, 
  mostly basketball. By the age of 7 I knew almost every stat of all the NBA players. You could say I was obsessed! However, now I am set on becoming 
  a software engineer. I did not start programming until I was in college. You could say CS1 was a challenging for me to say the least. However, 
  I love the CS program here at Kent. And I think I made the right career choice! I also like to cook. I find myself watching cooking videos all the time lately. 
  My main focus now is to master the medium rare steak! I like to baste it in a pan with garlic, thyme, and butter. It is so delicious! The last thing I would 
  like to share with you is that I am currently working as an information technology intern at Avita Health Systems in Galion, Ohio. 
  I have learned a lot about networking & server configuration while working there. However, it is not exactly what I want to do with my career, 
  but I still enjoy the work and the people I work with! </p>
